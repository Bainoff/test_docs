# Test documentation

Experienced in writing all kinds of test documentation during studying, practice process and on commercial projects. Such as:
 - test plans
 - requirements analysis
 - checklists
 - test scenarios (test suites)
 - test cases
 - bug reports
 - test result (summary) reports with metrics

Almost all of this stuff is protected by author rights and it's forbidden to share it. :confused: Pushed to this repository examples are just samples of my/team testing approach during studies or practice activity. Thanks for understanding!

Moreover familiar with plenty of such testing activities as:
 - preparing test data
 - setting up test environment
 - tasks estimation
 - agile (SCRUM, Kanban) rites.
